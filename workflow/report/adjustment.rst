We adjust powerplant location to the nearest shape and basin as long as they are within the allowed buffer distance.
Powerplants outside this buffer will be dropped.
This step will fail if either:

* The maximum number of powerplants outside shapes/basins is exceeded.
* The maximum number of dropped powerplants is exceeded.
